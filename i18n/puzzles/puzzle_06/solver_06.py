def preprocessing(puzzle_input):
    """
    Preprocesses the puzzle input by splitting it into words and crossword keys.
    
    The function handles two parts of the puzzle input:
    1. Word list: Some words are encoded in latin1 and need to be decoded to utf8
       - Every 3rd word is decoded
       - Every 5th word is decoded (which means words that are both 3rd and 5th will be decoded
         twice)
    
    2. Crossword clues: Extracts key information from each line of the crossword
       - First alphabetic character of the clue
       - Position of the first alphabetic character
       - Total length of the clue
    
    Args:
        puzzle_input (str): Raw puzzle input containing words section and crossword section
